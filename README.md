# Hi, I'm Tina 👋

**Writer + Vibe Coder** — I build content systems and ship products with AI.

27 years of professional writing (E! Networks, Dallas Market Center, Women's Wear Daily) meets AI-native development. I use Claude Code + Vercel to turn ideas into deployed products — fast.

## What I Build

## How I Work

I write detailed project specs and design briefs, then build with **Claude Code** — managing Git, Vercel deployments, Supabase databases, and DNS. Each project above went from concept to deployed product.
